The challenge is to develop mainstream application software that transparently scales its parallelism to leverage the increasing number of processor cores, much as 3D graphics applications transparently scale their parallelism to manycore GPUs with widely varying numbers of cores.},

Herein, we detail algorithmic advances developed to accelerate MD simulations on the Cell processor, a commodity processor found in PlayStation 3 (PS3). In particular, we discuss issues regarding memory access versus computation and the types of calculations which are best suited for streaming processors such as the Cell, focusing on implicit solvation models. We conclude with a comparison of improved performance on the PS3's Cell processor over more traditional processors. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2009},

abstract = {The hepatitis B virus capsid represents a promising therapeutic target. Experiments suggest the capsid must be flexible to function; however, capsid structure and dynamics have not been thoroughly characterized in the absence of icosahedral symmetry constraints. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are leveraged to investigate the capsid without symmetry bias, enabling study of capsid flexibility and its implications for biological function and cryo-EM resolution limits. Simulation results confirm flexibility and reveal a propensity for asymmetric distortion. The capsid’s influence on ionic species suggests a mechanism for modulating the display of cellular signals and implicates the capsid’s triangular pores as the location of signal exposure. A theoretical image reconstruction performed using simulated conformations indicates how capsid flexibility may limit the resolution of cryo-EM. Overall, the present work provides functional insight beyond what is accessible to experimental methods and raises important considerations regarding asymmetry in structural studies of icosahedral virus capsids.},

abstract = {We review and compare numerical methods that simultaneously control temperature while preserving the momentum, a family of particle simulation methods commonly used for the modelling of complex fluids and polymers. The class of methods considered includes dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as well as extended stochastic-dynamics models incorporating a generalized pairwise thermostat scheme in which stochastic forces are eliminated and the coefficient of dissipation is treated as an additional auxiliary variable subject to a feedback (kinetic energy) control mechanism. In the latter case, we consider the addition of a coupling of the auxiliary variable, as in the Nosé–Hoover–Langevin (NHL) method, with stochastic dynamics to ensure ergodicity, and find that the convergence of ensemble averages is substantially improved. To this end, splitting methods are developed and studied in terms of their thermodynamic accuracy, two-point correlation functions, and convergence. In terms of computational efficiency as measured by the ratio of thermodynamic accuracy to CPU time, we report significant advantages in simulation for the pairwise NHL method compared to popular alternative schemes (up to an 80% improvement), without degradation of convergence rate. The momentum-conserving thermostat technique described here provides a consistent hydrodynamic model in the low-friction regime, but it will also be of use in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular simulation applications owing to its efficiency and simple numerical implementation.}

It is shown that a slight modification to the algorithm is required before the Gibbs distribution is recovered as the stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. The temperature of the system is then directly related to the noise amplitude by means of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. However, the correspondingly modified, discrete DPD algorithm is only found to obey these predictions if the length of the time step is sufficiently reduced. This indicates the importance of time discretisation in DPD.}

Each such method may be viewed as generating samples according to an associated invariant measure that differs from the exact canonical invariant measure by a stepsize-dependent perturbation. We provide error estimates à la Talay–Tubaro on the invariant distribution for small stepsize, and compare the sampling bias obtained for various choices of the splitting method. We further investigate the overdamped limit and apply the methods in the context of driven systems where the goal is sampling with respect to a nonequilibrium steady state.

The efficiency of the method depends directly on how to build and use the neighbour list. In the present work, the available searching algorithms for SPH codes are analyzed. Different gridding algorithms are evaluated, the gains in efficiency obtained from reordering of particles is investigated and the cell-linked list and Verlet list methods are studied to create the neighbour list. Furthermore, an innovative searching procedure based on a dynamic updating of the Verlet list is proposed. The efficiency of the algorithms is analyzed in terms of computational time and memory requirements. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm based on linear bounding volume hierarchies (LBVHs) for computing neighbor (Verlet) lists using graphics processing units (GPUs) for colloidal systems characterized by large size disparities. We compare this to a GPU implementation of the current state-of-the-art CPU algorithm based on stenciled cell lists. We report benchmarks for both neighbor list algorithms in a Lennard-Jones binary mixture with synthetic interaction range disparity and a realistic colloid solution. LBVHs outperformed the stenciled cell lists for systems with moderate or large size disparity and dilute or semidilute fractions of large particles, conditions typical of colloidal systems.}

abstract = {The use of accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) has become popular in scientific computing applications due to their low cost, impressive floating-point capabilities, high memory bandwidth, and low electrical power requirements. Hybrid high-performance computers, machines with more than one type of floating-point processor, are now becoming more prevalent due to these advantages. In this work, we discuss several important issues in porting a large molecular dynamics code for use on parallel hybrid machines – (1) choosing a hybrid parallel decomposition that works on central processing units (CPUs) with distributed memory and accelerator cores with shared memory, (2) minimizing the amount of code that must be ported for efficient acceleration, (3) utilizing the available processing power from both multi-core CPUs and accelerators, and (4) choosing a programming model for acceleration. We present our solution to each of these issues for short-range force calculation in the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS, however, the methods can be applied in many molecular dynamics codes. Specifically, we describe algorithms for efficient short range force calculation on hybrid high-performance machines. We describe an approach for dynamic load balancing of work between CPU and accelerator cores. We describe the Geryon library that allows a single code to compile with both CUDA and OpenCL for use on a variety of accelerators. Finally, we present results on a parallel test cluster containing 32 Fermi GPUs and 180 CPU cores.}

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

A unified framework is developed within which the efficient generation of the neighbor list and maintaining particle data locality are addressed. Our algorithm generates strictly ordered neighbor lists in parallel, while the construction is deterministic and makes no use of atomic operations or sorting. Such neighbor list leads to optimal data loading efficiency when combined with a two-level particle reordering scheme. A faster in situ generation scheme for Gaussian random numbers is proposed using precomputed binary signatures. We designed custom transcendental functions that are fast and accurate for evaluating the pairwise interaction. The correctness and accuracy of the code is verified through a set of test cases simulating Poiseuille flow and spontaneous vesicle formation. Computer benchmarks demonstrate the speedup of our implementation over the CPU implementation as well as strong and weak scalability. A large-scale simulation of spontaneous vesicle formation consisting of 128 million particles was conducted to further illustrate the practicality of our code in real-world applications.

Unlike the approach based on the kernel independent fast multipole method (Ying et al., 2004) [31], which requires nine scalar FMM calls, the method presented here requires only four. We discuss its applications to Brownian dynamics simulation with hydrodynamic interactions, and present some timing results.}

RPYFMM offers a unified execution on both shared and distributed memory computers by leveraging the DASHMM library (DeBuhr et al., 2016, 2018). Preliminary numerical results show that the interactions for a molecular system of 15 million particles (beads) can be computed within one second on a Cray XC30 cluster using 12,288 cores, while achieving approximately 54% strong-scaling efficiency.

abstract = {A spectrally accurate fast method for electrostatic calculations under periodic boundary conditions is presented. We follow the established framework of FFT-based Ewald summation, but obtain a method with an important decoupling of errors: it is shown, for the proposed method, that the error due to frequency domain truncation can be separated from the approximation error added by the fast method. This has the significance that the truncation of the underlying Ewald sum prescribes the size of the grid used in the FFT-based fast method, which clearly is the minimal grid. Both errors are of exponential-squared order, and the latter can be controlled independently of the grid size. We compare numerically to the established SPME method by Essmann et al. and see that the memory required can be reduced by orders of magnitude. We also benchmark efficiency (i.e. error as a function of computing time) against the SPME method, which indicates that our method is competitive. Analytical error estimates are proven and used to select parameters with a great degree of reliability and ease.}

abstract = {The resolution of Brownian motion in simulations of micro-particle suspensions can be crucial to reproducing the correct dynamics of individual particles, as well as providing an accurate characterisation of suspension properties. Including these effects in simulations, however, can be computationally intensive due to the configuration dependent random displacements that would need to be determined at every time step. In this paper, we introduce the fluctuating force-coupling method (FCM) to overcome this difficulty, providing a fast approach to simulate colloidal suspensions at large-scale. We show explicitly that by forcing the surrounding fluid with a fluctuating stress and employing the FCM framework to obtain the motion of the particles, one obtains the random particle velocities and angular velocities that satisfy the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. This result holds even when higher-order multipoles, such as stresslets, are included in the FCM approximation. Through several numerical experiments, we confirm our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of fluctuating FCM, showing also how Brownian drift can be resolved by employing the appropriate time integration scheme and conjugate gradient method.}

abstract = {In this work we develop the Spectral Ewald Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (SEASD), a novel computational method for dynamic simulations of polydisperse colloidal suspensions with full hydrodynamic interactions. SEASD is based on the framework of Stokesian Dynamics (SD) with extension to compressible solvents, and uses the Spectral Ewald (SE) method [Lindbo and Tornberg (2010) [29]] for the wave-space mobility computation. To meet the performance requirement of dynamic simulations, we use Graphic Processing Units (GPU) to evaluate the suspension mobility, and achieve an order of magnitude speedup compared to a CPU implementation. For further speedup, we develop a novel far-field block-diagonal preconditioner to reduce the far-field evaluations in the iterative solver, and SEASD-nf, a polydisperse extension of the mean-field Brownian approximation of Banchio and Brady (2003) [39]. We extensively discuss implementation and parameter selection strategies in SEASD, and demonstrate the spectral accuracy in the mobility evaluation and the overall O(Nlog⁡N) computation scaling. We present three computational examples to further validate SEASD and SEASD-nf in monodisperse and bidisperse suspensions: the short-time transport properties, the equilibrium osmotic pressure and viscoelastic moduli, and the steady shear Brownian rheology. Our validation results show that the agreement between SEASD and SEASD-nf is satisfactory over a wide range of parameters, and also provide significant insight into the dynamics of polydisperse colloidal suspensions.}

abstract = {A spectrally accurate method for the fast evaluation of N-particle sums of the periodic Stokeslet is presented. Two different decomposition methods, leading to one sum in real space and one in reciprocal space, are considered. An FFT based method is applied to the reciprocal part of the sum, invoking the equivalence of multiplications in reciprocal space to convolutions in real space, thus using convolutions with a Gaussian function to place the point sources on a grid. Due to the spectral accuracy of the method, the grid size needed is low and also in practice, for a fixed domain size, independent of N. The leading cost, which is linear in N, arises from the to-grid and from-grid operations. Combining this FFT based method for the reciprocal sum with the direct evaluation of the real space sum, a spectrally accurate algorithm with a total complexity of O(NlogN) is obtained. This has been shown numerically as the system is scaled up at constant density.}

In the IB formulation, the fluid described by Eulerian variables is coupled with the immersed structure described by Lagrangian variables via the use of the Dirac delta function. From a numerical standpoint, the Lagrangian force spreading and the Eulerian velocity interpolation are carried out by a regularized, compactly supported discrete delta function, which is assumed to be a tensor product of a single-variable immersed-boundary kernel. IB kernels are derived from a set of postulates designed to achieve approximate grid translational invariance, interpolation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this note, we present a new 6-point immersed-boundary kernel that is C3 and yields a substantially improved translational invariance compared to other common IB kernels.}

abstract = {The effects of complex boundary conditions on flows are represented by a volume force in the immersed boundary methods. The problem with this representation is that the volume force exhibits non-physical oscillations in moving boundary simulations. A smoothing technique for discrete delta functions has been developed in this paper to suppress the non-physical oscillations in the volume forces. We have found that the non-physical oscillations are mainly due to the fact that the derivatives of the regular discrete delta functions do not satisfy certain moment conditions. It has been shown that the smoothed discrete delta functions constructed in this paper have one-order higher derivative than the regular ones. Moreover, not only the smoothed discrete delta functions satisfy the first two discrete moment conditions, but also their derivatives satisfy one-order higher moment condition than the regular ones. The smoothed discrete delta functions are tested by three test cases: a one-dimensional heat equation with a moving singular force, a two-dimensional flow past an oscillating cylinder, and the vortex-induced vibration of a cylinder. The numerical examples in these cases demonstrate that the smoothed discrete delta functions can effectively suppress the non-physical oscillations in the volume forces and improve the accuracy of the immersed boundary method with direct forcing in moving boundary simulations.}

This operation is often used when a calculation involving irregular positions is to be performed in Fourier space. We study several approaches for particle-mesh spreading on GPUs. A central concern is the use of atomic operations. We are also concerned with the case where spreading is performed multiple times using the same particle configuration, which opens the possibility of preprocessing to accelerate the overall computation time.

abstract = {We develop an inertial coupling method for modeling the dynamics of point-like “blob” particles immersed in an incompressible fluid, generalizing previous work for compressible fluids (Balboa Usabiaga et al., 2013 [42]). The coupling consistently includes excess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the displaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum equation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the formulation obeys a fluctuation–dissipation balance, owing to the non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal discretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the continuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and spreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in immersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels allow the blob to provide an effective model of a particle; specifically, the volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties of the blob are remarkably grid-independent. We develop a second-order semi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete fluctuation–dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity. Furthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and Helmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based implementation on GPUs. We numerically investigate the performance of the method on several standard test problems. In the deterministic setting, we find the blob to be a remarkably robust approximation to a rigid sphere, at both low and high Reynolds numbers. In the stochastic setting, we study in detail the short and long-time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function and observe agreement with all of the known behavior for rigid sphere immersed in a fluctuating fluid. The proposed inertial coupling method provides a low-cost coarse-grained (minimal resolution) model of particulate flows over a wide range of time-scales ranging from Brownian to convection-driven motion.}

    abstract = { Complex fluid-fluid interfaces are common to living systems, foods, personal products, and the environment. They occur wherever surface-active molecules and particles collect at fluid interfaces and render them nonlinear in their response to flow and deformation. When this occurs, the interfaces acquire a complex microstructure that must be interrogated. Interfacial rheological material properties must be measured to appreciate their role in such varied processes as lung function, cell division, and foam and emulsion stability. This review presents the methods that have been devised to determine the microstructure of complex fluid-fluid interfaces. Complex interfacial microstructure leads to rheological complexity. This behavior is often responsible for stabilizing interfacial systems such as foams and emulsions, and it can also have a profound influence on wetting/dewetting dynamics. Interfacial rheological characterization relies on the development of tools with the sensitivity to respond to small surface stresses in a way that isolates them from bulk stresses. This development is relatively recent, and reviews of methods for both shear and dilatational measurements are offered here. }

	abstract = {We study diffusion of colloids on a fluid–fluid interface using particle simulations and fluctuating hydrodynamics. Diffusion on a two-dimensional interface with three-dimensional hydrodynamics is known to be anomalous, with the collective diffusion coefficient diverging like the inverse of the wavenumber. This unusual collective effect arises because of the compressibility of the fluid flow in the plane of the interface, and leads to a nonlinear nonlocal convolution term in the diffusion equation for the ensemble-averaged concentration. We extend the previous hydrodynamic theory to account for a species/color labeling of the particles, as necessary to model experiments based on fluorescent techniques. We study the magnitude and dynamics of density and color density fluctuations using a novel Brownian dynamics algorithm, as well as fluctuating hydrodynamics theory and simulation. We find that hydrodynamic coupling between a single tagged particle and collective density fluctuations leads to a reduction of the long-time self-diffusion coefficient, even for an ideal gas of non-interacting particles. This unexpected finding demonstrates that density functional theories that do not account for thermal fluctuations are incomplete even for ideal systems. Using linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, we show that for diffusion on a fluid–fluid interface, nonequilibrium fluctuations of the total density are small compared to the equilibrium fluctuations, but fluctuations of color density are giant and exhibit a spectrum that decays as the inverse cubed power of the wavenumber. We confirm these predictions through Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusive mixing with two indistinguishable species. We also examine nonequilibrium fluctuations in systems with two-dimensional hydrodynamics, such as thin smectic films in vacuum. We find that nonequilibrium fluctuations are colossal and comparable in magnitude to the mean, and can be accurately modeled using numerical solvers for the nonlinear equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.}

abstract={This book provides a practical guide to molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques used in the modelling of simple and complex liquids. Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of condensed matter, complementing and reinforcing both experiment and theory. Simulations provide detailed information about structure and dynamics, essential to understand the many fluid systems that play a key role in our daily lives: polymers, gels, colloidal suspensions, liquid crystals, biological membranes, and glasses. The second edition of this pioneering book aims to explain how simulation programs work, how to use them, and how to interpret the results, with examples of the latest research in this rapidly evolving field. Accompanying programs in Fortran and Python provide practical, hands-on, illustrations of the ideas in the text.},

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.}

abstract  ="An operational procedure is presented to compute explicitly the different terms in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for a few relevant variables obtained within Mori–Zwanzig formalism. The procedure amounts to introducing an artificial controlled parameter which can be tuned in such a way that the so-called projected dynamics becomes explicit and the GLE reduces to a Markovian equation. The projected dynamics can be realised in practice by introducing constraints{,} and it is shown that the Green–Kubo formulae computed with these dynamics do not suffer from the plateau problem. The methodology is illustrated in the example of star polymer molecules in a melt using their center of mass as relevant variables. Through this example{,} we show that not only the effective potentials{,} but also the friction forces and the noise play a very important role in the dynamics."}

Our argument is supported by a simple analytical consideration and some numerical examples: We simulate the Wiener process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the diffusion in a Φ4 potential, using both Gaussian and uniform random numbers. In these examples, the rate of convergence of the mean first exit time is found to be nearly identical for both types of random numbers. }

abstract = {Abstract Chemicals capable of producing structural and chemical changes on cells are used to treat diseases (e.g., cancer). Further development and optimization of chemotherapies require thorough knowledge of the effect of the chemical on the cellular structure and dynamics. This involves studying, in a noninvasive way, the properties of individual cells after drug administration. Intracellular viscosity is affected by chemical treatments and it can be reliably used to monitor chemotherapies at the cellular level. Here, cancer cell monitoring during chemotherapeutic treatments is demonstrated using intracellular allocated upconverting nanorockers. A simple analysis of the polarized visible emission of a single particle provides a real-time readout of its rocking dynamics that are directly correlated to the cytoplasmic viscosity. Numerical simulations and immunodetection are used to correlate the measured intracellular viscosity alterations to the changes produced in the cytoskeleton of cancer cells by anticancer drugs (colchicine and Taxol). This study evidences the possibility of monitoring cellular properties under an external chemical stimulus for the study and development of new treatments. Moreover, it provides the biomedical community with new tools to study intracellular dynamics and cell functioning.},

abstract  ="We review the diverse range of materials made up of rod-shaped colloids. A common feature of such suspensions is the strong and efficient contribution of rods to the material{'}s solid-like rheological properties such as elastic modulus and yield stress. Colloidal rod suspensions span from biomaterials such as f-actin and fd virus to inorganic materials such as boehmite and hematite{,} and to commercial fibers such as cellulose. We argue that{,} depending on the strength of pair potential interactions{,} such rod suspensions form microstructures that vary between the two limits of heterogeneous fractal clusters and homogeneous fiber networks. The volume fraction range for transition between these two limiting cases is strongly aspect ratio dependent. The two limiting microstructures can be distinguished by differences in the scattering vector dependence of their structure factors{,} as long as the range of scattering vector probed is sufficient to span regimes both above and below qL ≈ 1. Here q is the scattering vector and L is the rod length. Theories of the Brownian dynamics of fractal clusters and fiber networks show that the two types of microstructure can lead to the arrested dynamics of gelation and the glass transition{,} respectively. The volume fraction and aspect ratio dependences of the dynamical slowing down of these two cases differ significantly; we suggest that probing these differences is a convenient way to distinguish between gels and glasses of colloidal rods. This distinction is important to clarify because these microstructures are determinants of rheological properties such as elasticity and yielding. By combining these structural and dynamical ideas about rods{,} we classify a set of literature measurements on more than fifteen different colloidal materials and thereby distinguish between regimes of gelation and vitrification. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research in the arrested dynamics{,} the non-linear rheology{,} and the absolute lower limit of gelation in colloidal rod suspensions."}

By separately studying both populations we find a simple phenomenological law for the mobile tracers αmob(p) ≈ a ln p + c where c ≈ 1 and a ∼ 0.2 depends on the gel type. On the other hand{,} a cluster-analysis of the gel accessible volume reveals a power law for the trapping probability ptrap ∼ (p/pc)−γ{,} with γ ≃ 2.9. This yields a prediction for the ensemble averaged subdiffusion exponent α = αmob(1 − ptrap). Our predictions are successfully validated against the different gels studied here and against numerical and experimental results in the literature (silica gels{,} polyacrylamide gels{,} flexible F-actin networks and in different random obstacles). Notably{,} the parameter a ∼ 0.2 presents small differences amongst all these cases{,} indicating the robustness of the proposed relation."}

    abstract = { We investigate tank-treading and breathing dynamics of individual star molecules under shear flow and their relation with the macromolecule architecture. Tank-treading consists of the rotation of the arms of the star around a molecule’s center, whereas breathing consists in expansions and contractions of the whole molecule at a certain characteristic frequency. We derive scaling arguments for the trends of the frequency and decorrelation rates of both rotation and breathing modes versus the shear rate γ̇, which are supported by extensive Brownian hydrodynamics simulations. We find that breathing occurs if γ̇ is made faster than the equilibrium decorrelation rate Γ0 of two perpendicular eigenvectors of the gyration tensor. Γ0 increases with the star functionality, F, as Γ0 ≈ F0.5, which contrasts with the rotational and arm-length relaxation rates (F–0.6 and F–0.15 respectively). For γ̇ > Γ0, the star becomes ellipsoidal and elongates in the flow direction and this determines the onset of the non-Newtonian regime. Remarkably, γ̇/Γ0 provides universal trends for the shape, dynamics, and rheology of the star polymer. }

A major shortcoming with these methods is that they construct levels of the tree sequentially, which limits the amount of parallelism that they can achieve. We present a novel approach that improves scalability by constructing the entire tree in parallel. Our main contribution is an in-place algorithm for constructing binary radix trees, which we use as a building block for other types of trees.},

We present two algorithms making use of ray packets, packet-warp and packet-block, which set the packet size to a warp and a block, respectively. We also analyze the influence of the packet size and packet shape by testing several configurations. Finally, we compare the time results we have obtained to previous related papers over a batch of usual scenes.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for neighbor search in molecular simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs) based on bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). The BVH is compressed into a low-precision, quantized representation to increase the BVH traversal speed compared to a previous implementation. We find that neighbor search using the quantized BVH is roughly two to four times faster than current state-of-the-art methods using uniform grids (cell lists) for a suite of benchmarks for common molecular simulation models. Based on the benchmark results, we recommend using the BVH instead of a single cell list for neighbor list generation in molecular simulations on GPUs.}
