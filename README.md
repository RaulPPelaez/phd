## Complex fluids in the GPU era: Algorithms and simulations

These are the latex sources for my Ph.D. manuscript and dissertation. The latter is included as a submodule, so clone recursively.



## Compilation requirements:

  * Make  
  * A lot of Latex packages (just install texlive-full)	  
  * inkscape  
  * python3-pygments  
  
To install everything in Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf -y install texlive-scheme-full inkscape make python3-pygments
```

I you experience some weird error, try deleting or renaming the ~/.texlive2020 folder.
