\gls{GPU} are super cool and the future (present).

Problems with porting CPU centric \gls{MD} packages to \gls{GPU}. Scalability in software.

The present and future of high performance computing.
CUDA vs alternatives.

Scientific computing in the GPU era.

Developing algorithms for the ground up with the GPU architecture in mind is essential. Leverage ultra efficient \gls{GPU} \gls{FFT} by developing spectral algorithms. Many times simplicity beats complexity.

State of the art in molecular simulations.
