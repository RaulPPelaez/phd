\chapter{Design principles}\label{ch:design}
Open infrastructure instead of closed ecosystem. Open source.
\section{Universality}
Anything goes as long as it has interacting entities. One could technically implement Chess as a module.
\section{Adaptability}
Highly templated code and super generic interfaces. 
\section{Mulstiscale}
From atoms in vacuum to chunks of oceans and planetary dynamics.
\section{Molecular Dynamics}
Using molecular in the sense of an arbitrarily coarsed-grained simulation unit (atoms, groups of atoms, colloids, groups of colloids, buckets of water, planets...)
