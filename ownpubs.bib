	title = {Hydrodynamic fluctuations in quasi-two dimensional diffusion},
	journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
	abstract = {We study diffusion of colloids on a fluid–fluid interface using particle simulations and fluctuating hydrodynamics. Diffusion on a two-dimensional interface with three-dimensional hydrodynamics is known to be anomalous, with the collective diffusion coefficient diverging like the inverse of the wavenumber. This unusual collective effect arises because of the compressibility of the fluid flow in the plane of the interface, and leads to a nonlinear nonlocal convolution term in the diffusion equation for the ensemble-averaged concentration. We extend the previous hydrodynamic theory to account for a species/color labeling of the particles, as necessary to model experiments based on fluorescent techniques. We study the magnitude and dynamics of density and color density fluctuations using a novel Brownian dynamics algorithm, as well as fluctuating hydrodynamics theory and simulation. We find that hydrodynamic coupling between a single tagged particle and collective density fluctuations leads to a reduction of the long-time self-diffusion coefficient, even for an ideal gas of non-interacting particles. This unexpected finding demonstrates that density functional theories that do not account for thermal fluctuations are incomplete even for ideal systems. Using linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, we show that for diffusion on a fluid–fluid interface, nonequilibrium fluctuations of the total density are small compared to the equilibrium fluctuations, but fluctuations of color density are giant and exhibit a spectrum that decays as the inverse cubed power of the wavenumber. We confirm these predictions through Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusive mixing with two indistinguishable species. We also examine nonequilibrium fluctuations in systems with two-dimensional hydrodynamics, such as thin smectic films in vacuum. We find that nonequilibrium fluctuations are colossal and comparable in magnitude to the mean, and can be accurately modeled using numerical solvers for the nonlinear equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.}

abstract = {Abstract Chemicals capable of producing structural and chemical changes on cells are used to treat diseases (e.g., cancer). Further development and optimization of chemotherapies require thorough knowledge of the effect of the chemical on the cellular structure and dynamics. This involves studying, in a noninvasive way, the properties of individual cells after drug administration. Intracellular viscosity is affected by chemical treatments and it can be reliably used to monitor chemotherapies at the cellular level. Here, cancer cell monitoring during chemotherapeutic treatments is demonstrated using intracellular allocated upconverting nanorockers. A simple analysis of the polarized visible emission of a single particle provides a real-time readout of its rocking dynamics that are directly correlated to the cytoplasmic viscosity. Numerical simulations and immunodetection are used to correlate the measured intracellular viscosity alterations to the changes produced in the cytoskeleton of cancer cells by anticancer drugs (colchicine and Taxol). This study evidences the possibility of monitoring cellular properties under an external chemical stimulus for the study and development of new treatments. Moreover, it provides the biomedical community with new tools to study intracellular dynamics and cell functioning.},

    abstract = { We investigate tank-treading and breathing dynamics of individual star molecules under shear flow and their relation with the macromolecule architecture. Tank-treading consists of the rotation of the arms of the star around a molecule’s center, whereas breathing consists in expansions and contractions of the whole molecule at a certain characteristic frequency. We derive scaling arguments for the trends of the frequency and decorrelation rates of both rotation and breathing modes versus the shear rate γ̇, which are supported by extensive Brownian hydrodynamics simulations. We find that breathing occurs if γ̇ is made faster than the equilibrium decorrelation rate Γ0 of two perpendicular eigenvectors of the gyration tensor. Γ0 increases with the star functionality, F, as Γ0 ≈ F0.5, which contrasts with the rotational and arm-length relaxation rates (F–0.6 and F–0.15 respectively). For γ̇ > Γ0, the star becomes ellipsoidal and elongates in the flow direction and this determines the onset of the non-Newtonian regime. Remarkably, γ̇/Γ0 provides universal trends for the shape, dynamics, and rheology of the star polymer. }

	abstract = {Cross-linked actin networks are the primary component of the cell cytoskeleton and have been the subject of numerous experimental and modeling studies. While these studies have demonstrated that the networks are viscoelastic materials, evolving from elastic solids on short timescales to viscous fluids on long ones, questions remain about the duration of each asymptotic regime, the role of the surrounding fluid, and the behavior of the networks on intermediate timescales. Here we perform detailed simulations of passively cross-linked actin networks to quantify the principal timescales involved in the elastoviscous behavior, study the role of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions, and derive continuum models from discrete stochastic simulations. To do this, we extend our recent computational framework for semiflexible filament suspensions, which is based on nonlocal slender body theory, to actin networks with dynamic cross linkers. We introduce a model where the cross linkers are elastic springs with sticky ends stochastically binding to and unbinding from the elastic filaments, which randomly turn over at a characteristic rate. We show that, depending on the parameters, the network evolves to a steady state morphology that is either an isotropic actin mesh or a mesh with embedded actin bundles. For different degrees of bundling, we numerically apply small-amplitude oscillatory shear deformation to extract three timescales from networks of hundreds of filaments and cross linkers. We analyze the dependence of these timescales, which range from the order of hundredths of a second to several seconds, on the dynamic nature of the links, solvent viscosity, and filament bending stiffness. We show that the network is mostly elastic on the short time scale, with the elasticity coming mainly from the cross links, and viscous on the long time scale, with the effective viscosity originating primarily from stretching and breaking of the cross links. We show that the influence of nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions depends on the network morphology: for homogeneous meshworks, nonlocal hydrodynamics gives only a small correction to the viscous behavior, but for bundled networks it both hinders the formation of bundles and significantly lowers the resistance to shear once bundles are formed. We use our results to construct continuum Maxwell-type models of the networks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
